### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    I really liked lab 7 because we got to code a game of blackjack. This lab gave my an appreciation for how we take simple things for granted, I had no idea it would take that much code to make a simple game of blackjack work. It was also fun because I had to teach my lab partner how blackjack worked. 

* Lab 1

    I liked lab 1 because it signified the start of my career in computer science. Although it was something so simple it felt really complicated at the time of doing it. Looking back now, I can see how far I've come in under a year and I can't wait to look back at the end of college to see my progress

* Lab 11

    I liked lab 11 because of the complexity of the situations we were asked to handle. Creating the 2d vectors with the counties and their populations was challenging, as was figuring out how to read from the vectors. Overall I think I just liked the challenge of this lab.
